# lane_detection
lane_detection 
there are two files :
         1-lane_detection from scratch that i wrote myself
         2-lane_detection from internet
to run the code you can use google colab 
*** note : 1st file will run for images only and when it runs for video the run freezes because of function cv2.imshow() ***
